# TPP MLIR

This is an experiment in using MLIR to automatically select the best [Tensor Processing Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05755) for linear algebra.

This repository contains an out-of-tree [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) dialect as well as an `opt`-like tool to operate on that dialect and a `runner`-like tool to execute and benchmark MLIR kernels.

It also contains the recipes to use [LIBXSMM](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm) from inside MLIR and can be used by other tools to drive our passes.

There's [work in progress](https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/tpp) inside [IREE](https://iree-org.github.io/iree/) to use this work on their pipeline.

This repository was previously called `tpp-sandbox`.
If you have a checkout with the previous name, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository) to rename the remote locally.

## Build Status

[![TPP build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/7c04eb392db7ba16b30684d80e0e4320254f7cf61558c6336f.svg)](https://buildkite.com/intel/tpp-compiler)

## How to build LLVM

```sh
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
# Please check-out the llvm version in: build_tools/llvm_version.txt
mkdir llvm-project/build
pushd llvm-project/build

# This is important for the next step
export CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT=`pwd`
echo $CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT
export PATH=$CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT/bin:$PATH

# Build
cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
   -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
   -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
   -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \
   -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;NVPTX;AMDGPU" \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
   -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
   -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
   -DLLVM_USE_LINKER=lld
ninja 

popd
```

## How to build TPP MLIR

This setup assumes that you have built LLVM and MLIR in `$CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT` as above.

```sh
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/plaidml/tpp-mlir.git
mkdir tpp-mlir/build
pushd tpp-mlir/build

# Build & test
cmake -G Ninja .. \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
   -DMLIR_DIR=$CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT/lib/cmake/mlir \
   -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT/bin/llvm-lit
cmake --build . --target check-tpp-opt

popd
```

To build the documentation from the TableGen description of the dialect
operations, run:

```sh
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```
