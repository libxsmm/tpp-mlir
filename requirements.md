# Requirements

This project uses Conda to create a more reproducible environment (`requirements.yml`). For details refer to Conda's documentation.

Conda's installation requirements can specify Python packages as part of the YAML based specification. However, this project installs Python packages like:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
