# Scripts

These scripts help build and maintain the project.

The `env.sh` script is sourcing the TPP-environment (`enable-tpp`) as well as the LLVM-runtime environment matching TPP-mlir (`$TPP_LLVM_DIR` or `$CUSTOM_LLVM_ROOT`).

```bash
cd tpp-mlir
source scripts/env.sh
```

For example, no path to `mlir-vulkan-runner` needs to be specified (`$PATH`).

```bash
mlir-vulkan-runner ~/llvm-project/mlir/test/mlir-vulkan-runner/addf.mlir -e main -entry-point-result=void \
  -shared-libs=$TPP_LLVM_DIR/lib/libvulkan-runtime-wrappers.so \
  -shared-libs=$TPP_LLVM_DIR/lib/libmlir_c_runner_utils.so \
  -shared-libs=$TPP_LLVM_DIR/lib/libmlir_runner_utils.so
```

## CI

Generic CI scripts that check for dependencies, prepare environments (Conda, Virtualenv, etc).
They can be used by multiple CI environments to do generic setup, not specific setup.
They can also be used by developers on their machines.

Scripts to CMake and build the project, run benchmarks etc.
These should be generic to all environments, including developers' own machines.
Given the appropriate dependencies are installed, these should work everywhere.

## Buildkite

Scripts executed by the Buildkite CI. There should be one script per rule, used by all different builds.

There are two types of scripts:

* YAML: Pipeline descrptions that the buildkite-agent will upload.
* BASH: Scripts that the YAML rules will call.

There should be no code in the YAML files. Bash scripts can depend on and reuse generic CI-scripts.

To run local tests like in the CI-environment (relies at least on the TPP-environment):

```bash
cd tpp-mlir
source scripts/env.sh
KIND=Debug COMPILER=clang LINKER=lld CHECK=1 GPU=vulkan CLEAN=1 scripts/buildkite/build_tpp.sh
```

Above scripts (scripts/env.sh) must be sourced from inside of the tpp-mlir directory (Git repository).
